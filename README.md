# My CS50x Journey
This is a repository that keeps a record of my journey taking Harvard University's popular CS50x online course taught by David J. Malan.

## Week 0 - Scratch
For the problem set 0 project I created a game using scratch called ["Space Invasion"](https://github.com/safwanishere/CS50/blob/main/Week%200/Space%20Invasion.sb3)
These are the instructions for the game:

> Space Invasion!
> 
> You control a rocket ship that can go left to right with the use of arrow keys or A and D keys on your keyboard. There is an invasion of random creatures with different speeds and killing points descending from above. Use the Space bar or the W key to shoot a laser. Your kill count and score is displayed on the top left.
> 
> key binds
> W - shoot
> A - move left
> D - move right
> spacebar - shoot
