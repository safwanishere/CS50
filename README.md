# My CS50x Journey
This is a repository that keeps a record of my journey taking Harvard University's popular CS50x online course taught by David J. Malan.

## Week 0 - Scratch
For the problem set 0 project I created a game using scratch called ["Space Invasion"](https://github.com/safwanishere/CS50/blob/main/Week%200)
These are the instructions for the game:

> Space Invasion!
> 
> You control a rocket ship that can go left to right with the use of arrow keys or A and D keys on your keyboard. There is an invasion of random creatures with different speeds and killing points descending from above. Use the Space bar or the W key to shoot a laser. Your kill count and score is displayed on the top left.
> 
> key binds
> W - shoot
> A - move left
> D - move right
> spacebar - shoot

## Week 1 - C
Introduced to the first programming language of the course, C. There were three questions in the problem set of this week. They were based on real life scenarios and problems and to be solved using the concepts of loops, variables, conditions and user inputs that were thought in the lecture videos.

### Hello, it's me
In a file called hello.c, in a folder called me, implement a program in C that prompts the user for their name and then says hello to that user. For instance, if the user’s name is Adele, your program should print hello, Adele\n!

### Mario
In a file called mario.c in a folder called mario-less, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:
```
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
```

### Cash
Suppose you work at a store and a customer gives you $1.00 (100 cents) for candy that costs $0.50 (50 cents). You’ll need to pay them their “change,” the amount leftover after paying for the cost of the candy. When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you’re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out (or annoy the customer!). In a file called cash.c in a folder called cash, implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents, as in the below:
```
Change owed: 70
4
```
